# Flask Routing Review + React

## Learning Goals

- Request / response cycle

- Building models

- Seeding data

- RESTful routes

- CORS

- Flask with React

## Getting Started - Backend

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
cd server
```

Build out the `Meme` model with these attributes:

```
img_url - string
caption - string
likes - integer
```

Set up the database:

```
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "create memes table"
flask db upgrade
```

Write routes you may need along with seeding the database (use `server/seed.py`)...

## Getting Started - Front End

Edit the `vite.config.js` to include proxy information. Change all routes to include the proxied route.

In a seperate terminal (at the root level):

```
npm install --prefix client
npm run dev --prefix client
```

Very importantly... delete the `db.json` file! We're replacing it!
